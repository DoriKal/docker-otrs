_**Note:**_ I'm still finishing up the OTRS 6 image, it is available for testing as **juanluisbaptiste/otrs:6beta**
****
Unofficial [OTRS 5 Free](http://www.otrs.com/software/) docker image. This repository contains the
*Dockerfiles* and all other files needed to build and run the container.

We also include a *MariaDB Dockerfile* for a pre-configured image with the [required database settings](http://otrs.github.io/doc/manual/admin/stable/en/html/installation.html).

The OTRS image doesn't include a SMTP service, decoupling applications into multiple containers makes it 
much easier to scale horizontally and reuse containers. If you don't have access to a SMTP server, you 
can instead link against this [SMTP relay](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-postfix) postfix container.

These images are based on the [official CentOS images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/centos/) and 
include the latest OTRS version. Older images will be tagged with the OTRS version they run. 

*Mod_perl* is enabled by default.

OTRS 4 image sources are still available in otrs-4_0_x branch.

### Build instructions

We use `docker-compose` to build the images. Clone this repo and then:

    cd docker-otrs
    sudo docker-compose build

This command will build all the images and pull the missing ones like the [SMTP relay](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-postfix). This SMTP relay container has its own configuration, you need to specify the environment variables for the SMTP account that will be used to send OTRS email notifications. Please take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-postfix).

### How to run it

By default, when the container is run it will load a default vanilla OTRS
installation (`OTRS_INSTALL=no`) that is ready to be configured as you need. However, you can load
a backup or run the installer by defining one of these environment variables:

* `OTRS_INSTALL=restore` Will restore the backup specified by `OTRS_BACKUP_DATE`
environment variable.
* `OTRS_BACKUP_DATE` is the backup name to restore. It can have two values:
   - Uncompressed backup: A directory with its name in the same *date_time* format that the OTRS backup
script uses, for example `OTRS_BACKUP_DATE="2015-05-26_00-32"` with the backup files inside. A backup file created with this image or with any OTRS installation will work (the backup script creates the directory with that name). This is useful when migrating from another OTRS install to this container.
   - Compressed backup file: A gzip tarball of the previously described directory with the backup files. These tarballs are created by this container when doing a backup.

Backups must be inside the */var/otrs/backups* directory (host mounted by default in the docker-compose file).

* `OTRS_DROP_DATABASE=yes` Will drop the otrs database it if already exists (by default the container will fail if the database already exists).

You need to mount that backups volume from somewhere, it can be from another volume (using *--volumes-from*) or mounting 
a host volume which contains the backup files.

* `OTRS_INSTALL=yes` Will run the installer which you can access at:

    http://localhost/otrs/install.pl

If you are running the container remotely, replace *localhost* with the server's hostname. 

There are also some other environment variables that can be set to customize
the default install:

* `OTRS_HOSTNAME` Sets the container's hostname (autogenerated if not defined).
* `OTRS_SYSTEM_ID` Sets the system's ticketing ID.
* `OTRS_ADMIN_EMAIL` Sets the admin user email.
* `OTRS_ORGANIZATION` Sets the organization name (ex: MyCompany Ltd.)
* `OTRS_DB_PASSWORD` otrs user database password. If it's not set the password will be randomly generated (recommended).
* `OTRS_ROOT_PASSWORD` root@localhost user password. Default password is `changeme`.
* `OTRS_POSTMASTER_FETCH_TIME` Sets the time interval (at otrs user's crontab) OTRS should fetch emails from the configured postmaster accounts. This value it's 10 minutes by default, but I like to set it to 5 minutes. Email fetching can be disabled altogether by setting this variable to 0 (useful while configuring).
* `OTRS_LANGUAGE` Set the default language for both agent and customer interfaces (For example, "es" for spanish).
* `OTRS_TICKET_COUNTER` Sets the starting point for the ticket counter.
* `OTRS_NUMBER_GENERATOR` Sets the ticket number generator, possible values are : *DateChecksum*, *Date*, *AutoIncrement* or *Random*.


Those environment variables is what you can configure by running the installer for a default install, plus other useful ones.

For production use there's another `docker-compose` file that points to the pre-built images. After adjusting the [`docker-compose-prod.yml`](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-otrs/blob/master/docker-compose-prod.yml) file with the previously described environment variables (don't forget to configure the [SMTP relay](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-postfix)), you can test the service with `docker-compose`:

    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up

This will pull and bring up all needed containers, link them and mount volumes according
to the `docker-compose-prod.yml` configuration file.

The default database password is `changeme`, to change it, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the 
`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable on the `mariadb` image definition before 
running `docker-compose`.

To start the containers in production mode the the `-d` parameter to the previous command:

    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml -p companyotrs up -d

After the containers finish starting up you can access the OTRS system at the following
addresses:

### Administration Interface
    http://$OTRS_HOSTNAME/otrs/index.pl

### Customer Interface
    http://$OTRS_HOSTNAME/otrs/customer.pl

### Installing OTRS modules

If you have installed any additional module, the OTRS container will reinstall them after an upgrade or when a container is removed so they continue working. 

### Changing OTRS default skins

The default skins and logos for the agent and customer interfaces can be controlled with the following
environment variables:

To set the agent interface skin set `OTRS_AGENT_SKIN` environment variable, for example:

    OTRS_AGENT_SKIN: "ivory"

To set the agent Interface logo set `OTRS_AGENT_LOGO`:

    OTRS_AGENT_LOGO: skins/Agent/ivory/img/your_logo.png

You can also control the logo's size and placement (set in px units):

    OTRS_AGENT_LOGO_HEIGHT: 50
    OTRS_AGENT_LOGO_RIGHT: 40
    OTRS_AGENT_LOGO_TOP: 5
    OTRS_AGENT_LOGO_WIDTH: 240

To set the customer interface skin set `OTRS_CUSTOMER_SKIN` environment variable, for example:

    OTRS_CUSTOMER_SKIN: "ivory"

To set the customer Interface logo set `OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO`:

    OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO: skins/Customer/ivory/img/your_logo.png

You can also control the logo's size and placement (set in px units):

    OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO_HEIGHT: 50
    OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO_RIGHT: 40
    OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO_TOP: 5
    OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO_WIDTH: 240


If you are adding your own skins, the easiest way is create your own `Dockerfile` inherited from this image and then `COPY` the skin files there. You can also set all the environment variables in there too, for example:

    FROM juanluisbaptiste/otrs:latest
    MAINTAINER Foo Bar <foo@bar.com>
    ENV OTRS_AGENT_SKIN mycompany
    ENV OTRS_AGENT_LOGO skins/Agent/mycompany/img/logo.png
    ENV OTRS_CUSTOMER_LOGO skins/Customer/default/img/logo_customer.png

    COPY skins/ $SKINS_PATH/
    RUN mkdir -p $OTRS_ROOT/Kernel/Config/Files/
    COPY skins/Agent/MyCompanySkin.xml $OTRS_ROOT/Kernel/Config/Files/

### Using host-mounted data containers

The included docker-compose file uses `host mounted data containers` to store the database and configuration contents outside the containers. Please take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` to see the directory mappings and adjust them to your needs (available on both OTRS 4 & 5 images).

#### Note ####
Make sure that the directories on the docker host for both OTRS configuration and the MySQL data containers have the correct permissions to be accessed from within the containers. The `volumes/mysql` directory should be owned by the MySQL user (27) and the `volumes/config` directory must be owned by id 500 and group id 48. Before running `docker-compose up` make sure permissions are ok:

    chown 27 volumes/mysql
    chown 500:48 volumes/config

### Backups

Run `/opt/otrs/scripts/otrs_backup.sh` script to create a full backup that will be copied to */var/otrs/backups*. If you mounted that directory as a host volume then you will have access to the backups files from the docker host server. You can setup a periodic cron job on the host that runs the following command:

    docker exec otrs_container /opt/otrs/scripts/otrs_backup.sh

### Enabling debug mode ###

If you are having issues starting up the containers you can set `OTRS_DEBUG=yes` to print a more verbose container startup output.
